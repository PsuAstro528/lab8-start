## GPU Computing

## Exercise 1:  GPU Computing I: Getting Started with GPU Computing & Linear Algebra
### Goals:  
- Run GPU code on Roar
- Accelerate linear algebra computations with GPU 
- Recognize what problem sizes and likely to result in acceleration with a GPU for linear algebra

Work through ex1.jl, either in the Pluto notebook (with a classmate or outside of class) or by submitting ex1.slurm and viewing the output figures and html file.  

## Exercise 2:  GPU Computing II: GPU Kernels, Reductions
### Goals:  
- Perform custom scientific computations using a high-level GPU interface
- Improve performance by reducing kernel launches via broadcasting and GPU kernel fusion
- Improve performance by reducing memory transfers via GPU reductions
- Recognize what types of problems and problem sizes are likely to result in acceleration with a GPU  when using a custom kernel

Work through ex2.ipynb, either in the Jupyter notebook (with a classmate or outside of class) or by submitting ex2.slurm and viewing the output html file.
